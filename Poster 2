To begin use the command ls to view all directories
Then use cd to enter a chosen directory
Use ls again view all current available files within the directory
Then we must write a code using grep
file * | grep -v JPEP
This code will then show if any files that are different to the rest
If a file does not appear, retry last steps on a different directory using cd\ to leave your current directory
If a code does apper use strings on the file and the flag should be found at the bottom
